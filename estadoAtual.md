### Repository Cleanup
We reorganized the project structure t
o maintain a clean root directory. Legacy files
 and previous versions were moved to \`old/\` to reduce clutter while preserving history.

### Future Roadmap (Next Session)
The following tasks have been identifi
ed for the next development phase:

1.  **Code Refactoring & Cleanup**:
    *   Remove unused files/folders (p
ost-restructure).
    *   Eliminate code duplication.
    *   Ensure overall correctness and
 type safety.
2.  **Security Audit**:
    *   Comprehensive review of all en
dpoints and access controls.
    *   Dependency vulnerability scan.

3.  **Visual Identity Update (Landing 
Page)**:
    *   Update Landing Page to reflect
 new Kybernus branding guidelines.
    *   Move away from the current pla
ceholder aesthetics to a bespoke identity.
4.  **E2E Testing Expansion**:
    *   Cover **ALL** edge cases (netw
ork failures, invalid inputs, payment declines)
.
    *   Cover all normal user flows (S
ign up -> Trial -> Upgrade -> Usage).
