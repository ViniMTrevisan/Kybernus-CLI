# Core Concepts

Understand the philosophy behind Kybernus and how it structures your applications for success.

## 1. Tiers & Pricing

Kybernus operates on a **Paid** model. We believe every developer should have access to professional-grade tools, while offered specialized features for enterprise and scaling teams.

| Feature | Free Tier | Pro Tier 🌟 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Philosophy** | "Get it working fast" | "Scale and maintain forever" |
| **Best For** | MVPs, Hackathons, Learners | Enterprise, long-term SaaS, Teams |
| **Stacks** | Node.js (Express), Java Spring Boot | **+ NestJS, Python FastAPI, Next.js** |
| **Architectures** | MVC (Standard Layered) | **+ Clean Architecture, Hexagonal** |
| **DevOps** | Basic `package.json` scripts | **Docker, CI/CD, Terraform** |
| **AI Docs** | Manual | **Automated via Google Gemini** |
| **Support** | Community | Priority Email |

## 2. Architectures

One size does not fit all. Kybernus allows you to choose the architectural pattern that fits your project's complexity.

### MVC (Model-View-Controller)
*   **Available**: Free & Pro.
*   **Structure**: Controllers handling requests, Services for logic, Repositories for data.
*   **Pros**: Simple, familiar, fast to build.
*   **Cons**: Can become "spaghetti code" in very large apps. Tight coupling between layers.

### Clean Architecture 
*   **Available**: Pro Only.
*   **Structure**: Based on Uncle Bob's principles. Domain-centric.
    *   `Domain`: Entities and Repository Interfaces (No dependencies).
    *   `UseCases`: Application business rules.
    *   `Infrastructure`: Database implementations, external APIs.
    *   `Presentation`: Controllers/Resolvers.
*   **Pros**: Framework independent, highly testable, extremely maintainable.
*   **Cons**: More boilerplate code upfront.

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) 
*   **Available**: Pro Only.
*   **Structure**:
    *   `Core`: Business domain.
    *   `Ports`: Interfaces defining input (Driver) and output (Driven).
    *   `Adapters`: Implementations (API, Database, Messaging).
*   **Pros**: Easy to swap infrastructure (e.g., change Postgres to Mongo without touching logic).
*   **Cons**: Conceptual learning curve.

## 3. Project Structure

Regardless of the stack, Kybernus projects share a common DNA:

*   **Standardized configuration**: `.env`, ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript (where applicable).
*   **Consistency**: A Java Spring project and a NestJS project generated by Kybernus follow similar organizational principles, making it easy for polyglot teams to switch contexts.
