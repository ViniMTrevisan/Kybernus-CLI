## I Have a Question

If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://kybernus.com/docs).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/ViniMTrevisan/Kybernus-CLI/issues) that might help you. In case you've found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

## I Want To Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the documentation carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Open a new issue with a descriptive title and clear steps to reproduce.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Perform a search to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Open a new issue with a descriptive title and detailed description of the proposed enhancement, including why it is needed and how it should work.

- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
