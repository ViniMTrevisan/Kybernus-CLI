# Models Directory

In an MVC application using Prisma, the true database models are defined centrally in `prisma/schema.prisma`. 

This `models/` directory is typically used for:
1. **Interfaces and Types**: TypeScript interfaces for data structures that don't directly map to the database (e.g., API response structures, complex DTOs).
2. **Business Logic Models**: domain-driven models if your application requires a thicker model layer than what Prisma Client provides by default.
3. **Mongoose/Sequelize**: If you were to swap Prisma out for an ODM like Mongoose or another ORM like Sequelize, those definitions would live here.

Since we are using Prisma, you can simply import types directly generated by Prisma Client (e.g., `import { User, Item } from '@prisma/client'`) where needed.
